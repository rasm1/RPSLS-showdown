        <h1>Origin</h1>
        <p>Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock (rpsls) is an expansion of the classic rock paper scissors. The game was created by Sam Kass with Karen Bryla to expand the pool of available option during play. <br>
            Sam and his wife found that playing the original game often resulted in a tie where both players picked the same option. To remedy this Sam and his wife added two new options to the game, namely lizard and Spock.<br>
            Spock was introduced because both of them were quite geeky and loved star trek so they jumped at the chance to incorporate one of their favorite characters into the game.
            The option lizard was later added when the duo decided on what gesture to use, pointing all the fingers forward  resulted in the gesture looking like a 'lizard'.<br>

            The game was popularized after it featured in an episode of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5Q6-wMx-K8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The big bang theory: "The Rothman Disintegration"</a> where Sheldon Cooper lays out the rules in a very comedic fashion.
